                <p>I am currently, as of June 2020 when this guide was started, a jobhunter.</p>
                <p>What I found out is that modern tech companies, especially those especializing in web development and/or UX, have ReactJS as their main goto library for designing interfaces. Here in Brazil much is said about learning Python to magically triple your salary, but as of right now what I see most are great opportunities in Javascript and especially ReactJS/NodeJS development. Thus I decided to create this guide for teaching, learning and using it as a reference whenever I forget a certain small detail here and there - hey, we're all human!</p>
                <p>Now, job skill tests tend to be very focused on the theoretical parts of the language, but most courses I have seen are very, very practical oriented; this creates a gap where a programmer can create a full (poorly functioning, poorly optimized) React application without barely understanding what's happening under the hood. This is not the type of programmer I want anyone to be, so let's try to build a bridge in here...</p>
                <p>I will copy some text verbatim and some examples from the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">React docs</a>. I suggest reading it and using it to clear up anything you don't understand from my explanations - and vice-versa. The important thing is for us all to learn and improve ourselves. Good luck on your journey!</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>ReactJS is a <strong>front-end Javascript library</strong> made public in 2013 by Facebook. This library powers many of the websites we use on our day-to-day lives such as Facebook (obviously), Instagram, Netflix, imgur and others.</p>
                <p>Let's consider the 3 words in <strong>bold</strong> in the last paragraph:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Front-end</strong>: ReactJS is used to design the front-end of an application - the part that the user looks at and directly interacts with. In the MVC model, this would be part of your View. React can also be used to make smartphone apps by the usage of React Native; this might be covered in another guide futurely...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Javascript</strong>: Through the use of its capabilities, you will be able to leverage all of Javascript to build your Views - this means that we'll be using HTML and CSS inside Javascript, which seems crazy at first, but soon enough you'll know what the advantages of this approach are.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Library</strong>: React is a library - it is not a framework, remember that on your job interviews. Being a library, it is very easy to integrate in a currently existing webpage or system; we'll look into that pretty soon.
                    </li>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>React is a library, and thus it requires NodeJS to be installed in your computer. Setting up an environment is something I wish to not be stuck on; I will just drop a link to some good guides which teaches you how to do it in Windows. If you're using Linux, try looking up on Google for information for your specific platform.</p>
                <p><a href="https://makandracards.com/reactjs-quick/52419-install-reactjs-windows">Setting up React on Windows</a> - I tested this and it works as of May 2020. You don't *need* to install Visual Studio Code (albeit I do recommend it), you can use another IDE of your choice if you prefer.</p>
                <p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Node.js_">Setting up Node on Linux - ArchWiki</a> - you need to setup a Node environment before you can install the React library, once Node is installed, install React through NPM (npm install -g create-react-app). Sudo may be necessary.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.devmedia.com.br/como-instalar-o-node-js-npm-e-o-react-no-windows/40329">Setting up Node, NPM and React - DevMedia (Português do Brasil)</a> - se você não sabe Inglês, nem sei como você chegou a esse ponto do guia, mas de qualquer forma essas instruções são bem claras.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h5>Introducing JSX - the (optional) file format for React</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Let's start with the basics! Have you ever heard of <strong>JSX</strong>?</p>
                <p>JSX is an acronym for <em>Javascript XML</em>, which is defined by the React docs "a syntax extension to Javascript". This vague definition does not tell us all the history; more consistently, JSX extends Javascript syntax by allowing us to write HTML and CSS code within the scope of a Javascript function or class, which is compiled by a compiler called Babel and outputs plain Javascript functions. You can see this in action by looking at the Babel online compiler <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/">available right here</a>. Other compilers could be used if you really want, but you don't have to worry about that in most cases, Babel is just fine.</p>
                <p>To be fair, <strong>JSX is not necessary for you to build a React app</strong>. <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">"anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript"</a>, because in reality everything you do in JSX is just a call to <code>React.createElement()</code>. This means in theory you can create an entire web app in just one HTML file - of course, <u>don't actually do this</u>; this is just an example on how flexible React is.</p>

            <div class="card">
            <div class="card-header"><h5>JSX: isn't HTML inside JS a bad thing?</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>You now know what is JSX, but why should you care about it? Or even: why not use plain Javascript to manipulate your HTML documents?</p>
                <p>Well, you see, JSX is quite powerful. In the <span class="oldstyle">old days of web development</span>, Javascript was used as an accessory to an HTML document - you could manipulate DOM by using certain pure Javascript methods (document.getElement(...)), but this approach limited developers in certain ways. For example, if you needed to repeat a certain HTML element (e.g a list item inside a user list) that was static in appearance but was dynamic in its content (e.g each list item had a different user name), things could get <em>complicated</em>. Here's a concise definition of <em>complicated</em>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your webpage could get very messy in terms of markup; unclosed tags, unescaped single/double quotes and others hellish situations;</li>
                    <li>In bizarre situations, you might even end up declaring a <code>script</code> inside a <code>script</code> (I have seen this, and it is ugly);</li>
                    <li>HTML inside Javascript inside HTML(TM) is very, very slow and complex to render;</li>
                    <li>HTML inside Javascript inside HTML's very complex render is all done on client-side. Goodbye, battery life! Hello, terrible UX!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, how do you reuse an HTML element without exploding the user's device?</p>
                <p>Many frameworks and libraries found workarounds for these problems - for example, Laravel uses Blade, which builds a page in the server-side allowing you to use PHP (to e.g. repeat a certain styled <code>div</code> with dynamic content) and delivers to the client a static webpage. This works pretty well - I use Laravel a lot on my web systems - but React goes even beyond. You'll understand in the next <code>section</code>.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h5>JSX: HTML inside JS instead of JS inside HTML</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>For a long time, in the <span class="oldstyle">old days of web development</span>, what we did was put Javascript inside HTML to manipulate the DOM in certain ways as discussed in the previous <code>section</code>. With React, we do the opposite: through the React library, Javascript code dictates how things should be rendered on the front-end. Now, for the first time, let's look at some code!</p>
                <code>
                    const name = 'Josh Perez';<br>
                    const element = &lt;h1>Hello, {name}&lt;/h1>;<br>
                    <br>
                    ReactDOM.render(<br>
                      element,<br>
                      document.getElementById('root')<br>
                    );<br>
                </code>
                <p>Okay, this is... Different from what we are used to. What is happening here? Let's break it down piece-by-piece:</p>
                <code>const name = 'Josh Perez';<br>
                const element = &lt;h1>Hello, {name}&lt;/h1>;</code>
                <p>The first line is simply declaring a constant called <code>name</code>, like you would expect in regular JS. The next line is where the fun begins; we have declared a constant called <code>element</code>; it literally is an HTML element <code>h1</code>, which will be passed to ReactDOM's method render():</p>
                <code>ReactDOM.render(<br>
                      element,<br>
                      document.getElementById('root')<br>
                    );<br>
                </code>
                <p>The method signature for <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> is:</p>
                <code>ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])</code>
                <p>This means that <code>render()</code> receives an HTML element <code>element</code> as described by the variable of the same name, and does its magic to load <code>element</code> inside the HTML element whose ID is <code>root</code>. Pretty intuitive, right?</p>
                <p>On a fresh (or relatively simple/unmodified) React project, if you browse the folder <code>[PROJECT ROOT]/public/index.html</code>, you'll see this:</p>
                <code>
                    <div id="root"></div><br>
                    &lt;!-- big comment here - read it, it's informative -->
                </code>
                <p><em>This is important:</em><code>ReactDOM.render()</code> is normally called only once on each "page load", and its function is to receive a fully constructed page and show it to the user. Calling it multiple times will simply replace the previous content of the <code>innerHtml</code> of the parent (like the <code>div</code> whose ID is <code>root</code> in our previous example).</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Towards the very end of the last section, I used the term "page load" between quotes. This is because a project that is fully built with React <em>doesn't change pages</em>, at least not in the way we are used to if you come from a raw HTML/JS context.</p>
