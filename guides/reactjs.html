                <p>I am currently, as of June 2020 when this guide was started, a jobhunter.</p>
                <p>What I found out is that modern tech companies, especially those especializing in web development and/or UX, have ReactJS as their main goto library for designing interfaces. Here in Brazil much is said about learning Python to magically triple your salary, but as of right now what I see most are great opportunities in Javascript and especially ReactJS/NodeJS development. Thus I decided to create this guide for teaching, learning and using it as a reference whenever I forget a certain small detail here and there - hey, we're all human!</p>
                <p>Now, job skill tests tend to be very focused on the theoretical parts of the language, but most courses I have seen are very, very practical oriented; this creates a gap where a programmer can create a full (poorly functioning, poorly optimized) React application without barely understanding what's happening under the hood. This is not the type of programmer I want anyone to be, so let's try to build a bridge in here...</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>ReactJS is a <strong>front-end Javascript library</strong> made public in 2013 by Facebook. This library powers many of the websites we use on our day-to-day lives such as Facebook (obviously), Instagram, Netflix, imgur and others.</p>
                <p>Let's consider the 3 words in <strong>bold</strong> in the last paragraph:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Front-end</strong>: ReactJS is used to design the front-end of an application - the part that the user looks at and directly interacts with. In the MVC model, this would be part of your View. React can also be used to make smartphone apps by the usage of React Native; this might be covered in another guide futurely...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Javascript</strong>: Through the use of its capabilities, you will be able to leverage all of Javascript to build your Views - this means that we'll be using HTML and CSS inside Javascript, which seems crazy at first, but soon enough you'll know what the advantages of this approach are.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Library</strong>: React is a library - it is not a framework, remember that on your job interviews. Being a library, it is very easy to integrate in a currently existing webpage or system; we'll look into that pretty soon.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Setting up your computer to run a React environment is something I wish to not be stuck on; I will just drop a link to a very good guide which teaches you how to do it in Windows. If you're using Linux, try looking up on Google for information for your specific platform.</p>
                <a href="https://makandracards.com/reactjs-quick/52419-install-reactjs-windows">Setting up React on Windows</a> - I tested this and it works as of May 2020. You don't *need* to install Visual Studio Code (albeit I do recommend it), you can use another IDE of your choice if you prefer.
                <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Node.js_">Setting up Node on Linux - ArchWiki</a> - you need to setup a Node environment before you can install the React library.
