                <p>I am currently, as of June 2020 when this guide was started, a jobhunter.</p>
                <p>What I found out is that modern tech companies, especially those especializing in web development and/or UX, have ReactJS as their main goto library for designing interfaces. Here in Brazil much is said about learning Python to magically triple your salary, but as of right now what I see most are great opportunities in Javascript and especially ReactJS/NodeJS development. Thus I decided to create this guide for teaching, learning and using it as a reference whenever I forget a certain small detail here and there - hey, we're all human!</p>
                <p>Now, job skill tests tend to be very focused on the theoretical parts of the language, but most courses I have seen are very, very practical oriented; this creates a gap where a programmer can create a full (poorly functioning, poorly optimized) React application without barely understanding what's happening under the hood. This is not the type of programmer I want anyone to be, so let's try to build a bridge in here...</p>
                <p>I will copy some text verbatim and some examples from the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">React docs</a>. I suggest reading it and using it to clear up anything you don't understand from my explanations - and vice-versa. The important thing is for us all to learn and improve ourselves. Good luck on your journey!</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>ReactJS is a <strong>front-end Javascript library</strong> made public in 2013 by Facebook. This library powers many of the websites we use on our day-to-day lives such as Facebook (obviously), Instagram, Netflix, imgur and others.</p>
                <p>Let's consider the 3 words in <strong>bold</strong> in the last paragraph:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Front-end</strong>: ReactJS is used to design the front-end of an application - the part that the user looks at and directly interacts with. In the MVC model, this would be part of your View. React can also be used to make smartphone apps by the usage of React Native; this might be covered in another guide futurely...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Javascript</strong>: Through the use of its capabilities, you will be able to leverage all of Javascript to build your Views - this means that we'll be using HTML and CSS inside Javascript, which seems crazy at first, but soon enough you'll know what the advantages of this approach are.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Library</strong>: React is a library - it is not a framework, remember that on your job interviews. Being a library, it is very easy to integrate in a currently existing webpage or system; we'll look into that pretty soon.
                    </li>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>React is a library, and thus it requires NodeJS to be installed in your computer. Setting up an environment is something I wish to not be stuck on; I will just drop a link to some good guides which teaches you how to do it in Windows. If you're using Linux, try looking up on Google for information for your specific platform.</p>
                <p><a href="https://makandracards.com/reactjs-quick/52419-install-reactjs-windows">Setting up React on Windows</a> - I tested this and it works as of May 2020. You don't *need* to install Visual Studio Code (albeit I do recommend it), you can use another IDE of your choice if you prefer.</p>
                <p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Node.js_">Setting up Node on Linux - ArchWiki</a> - you need to setup a Node environment before you can install the React library, once Node is installed, install React through NPM (npm install -g create-react-app). Sudo may be necessary.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.devmedia.com.br/como-instalar-o-node-js-npm-e-o-react-no-windows/40329">Setting up Node, NPM and React - DevMedia (Português do Brasil)</a> - se você não sabe Inglês, nem sei como você chegou a esse ponto do guia, mas de qualquer forma essas instruções são bem claras.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h5>Introducing JSX - the (optional) file format for React</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Let's start with the basics! Have you ever heard of <strong>JSX</strong>?</p>
                <p>JSX is an acronym for <em>Javascript XML</em>, which is defined by the React docs "a syntax extension to Javascript". This vague definition does not tell us all the history; more consistently, JSX extends Javascript syntax by allowing us to write HTML and CSS code within the scope of a Javascript function or class, which is compiled by a compiler called Babel and outputs plain Javascript functions. You can see this in action by looking at the Babel online compiler <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/">available right here</a>. Other compilers could be used if you really want, but you don't have to worry about that in most cases, Babel is just fine.</p>
                <p>To be fair, <strong>JSX is not necessary for you to build a React app</strong>. <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">"anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript"</a>, because in reality everything you do in JSX is just a call to <code>React.createElement()</code>. This means in theory you can create an entire web app in just one HTML file - of course, <u>don't actually do this</u>; this is just an example on how flexible React is.</p>

    <section class="container">
            <div class="card">
            <div class="card-header"><h5>JSX: isn't HTML inside JS a bad thing?</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>You now know what is JSX, but why should you care about it? Or even: why not use plain Javascript to manipulate your HTML documents?</p>
                <p>Well, you see, JSX is quite powerful. In the <span class="oldstyle">old days of web development</span>, Javascript was used as an accessory to an HTML document - you could manipulate DOM by using certain pure Javascript methods (document.getElement(...)), but this approach limited developers in certain ways. For example, if you needed to repeat a certain HTML element (e.g a list item inside a user list) that was static in appearance but was dynamic in its content (e.g each list item had a different user name), things could get <em>complicated</em>. Here's a concise definition of <em>complicated</em>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your webpage could get very messy in terms of markup; unclosed tags, unescaped single/double quotes and others hellish situations;</li>
                    <li>In bizarre situations, you might even end up declaring a <code>script</code> inside a <code>script</code> (I have seen this, and it is ugly);</li>
                    <li>HTML inside Javascript inside HTML(TM) is very, very slow and complex to render;</li>
                    <li>HTML inside Javascript inside HTML's very complex render is all done on client-side. Goodbye, battery life! Hello, terrible UX!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So, how do you reuse an HTML element without exploding the user's device, and still adhere to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle</a>?</p>
                <p>Many frameworks and libraries found workarounds for these problems - for example, Laravel uses Blade, which builds a page in the server-side allowing you to use PHP (to e.g. repeat a certain styled <code>div</code> with dynamic content) and delivers to the client a static webpage. This works pretty well - I use Laravel a lot on my web systems - but React goes even beyond. You'll understand in the next <code>section</code>.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h5>JSX and Elements</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>For a long time, in the <span class="oldstyle">old days of web development</span>, what we did was put Javascript inside HTML to manipulate the DOM in certain ways as discussed in the previous <code>section</code>. With React, we do the opposite: through the React library, Javascript code dictates how things should be rendered on the front-end. Now, for the first time, let's look at some code!</p>
                <code>
                    const name = 'Josh Perez';<br>
                    const element = &lt;h1>Hello, {name}&lt;/h1>;<br>
                    <br>
                    ReactDOM.render(<br>
                      element,<br>
                      document.getElementById('root')<br>
                    );<br>
                </code>
                <p>Okay, this is... Different from what we are used to. What is happening here? Let's break it down piece-by-piece:</p>
                <code>const name = 'Josh Perez';<br>
                const element = &lt;h1>Hello, {name}&lt;/h1>;</code>
                <p>The first line is simply declaring a constant called <code>name</code>, like you would expect in regular JS. The next line is where the fun begins; we have declared a constant called <code>element</code>; it literally is an HTML element <code>h1</code>, which will be passed to ReactDOM's method render():</p>
                <code>ReactDOM.render(<br>
                      element,<br>
                      document.getElementById('root')<br>
                    );<br>
                </code>
                <p>The method signature for <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> is:</p>
                <code>ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback])</code>
                <p>This means that <code>render()</code> receives an HTML element <code>element</code> as described by the variable of the same name, and does its magic to load <code>element</code> inside the HTML element whose ID is <code>root</code>. Pretty intuitive, right?</p>
                <p>On a fresh (or relatively simple/unmodified) React project, if you browse the folder <code>[PROJECT ROOT]/public/index.html</code>, you'll see this:</p>
                <code>
                    &lt;div id="root">&lt;/div><br>
                    &lt;!-- big comment here - read it, it's informative -->
                </code>
                <p>So this your parent for element. <em>We call this a "root" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM</em> (verbatim from React Docs).</p>
                <p>Also, <em>this is good to know:</em> <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> is normally called only once on each "page load", and its function is to receive a fully constructed page and show it to the user. Calling it multiple times will simply replace the previous content of the <code>innerHtml</code> of the parent (like the <code>div</code> whose ID is <code>root</code> in our previous example). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170916072252/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46236593/calling-reactdom-render-more-than-once">See this StackOverflow question for more information.</a></p>
                <p>Lastly for this section, if you're coming from other web development contexts *especially PHP*, then you must know already that you NTUI (Never Trust User Input), not only on the backend but also in the frontend. On PHP you would use <code>htmlspecialchars()</code> to clear use output before delivering the page, and in React, the following has a similar function:</p>
                <code>
                    const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;<br>
                    const element = &lt;h1>{title}&lt;/h1>;
                </code>
                <p>This cleans your output. <code>element</code> can be rendered without worries. For more information, <a href="https://medium.com/@arunrajeevan/how-react-helps-in-mitigating-cross-site-scripting-xss-attack-2f724c9e9242">read up this great text by Arun Rajeevan</a>.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h5>Elements: Rendering</h5></div>
                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Let us go back to a very familiar example, presented in the last section:</p>
                    <code>
                        const name = 'Josh Perez';<br>
                        const element = &lt;h1>Hello, {name}&lt;/h1>;<br>
                        <br>
                        ReactDOM.render(<br>
                          element,<br>
                          document.getElementById('root')<br>
                        );<br>
                    </code>
                <p>Once render() is called, the element is immutable. This means that its attributes cannot be altered once it's been rendered (i.e you can't change "Josh Perez" to "John Gonzales" after rendering), but that does not mean that the element has to be visually static.</p>
                <p>If you were to build a simple clock using React, which has to be updated every 1 second (1000 miliseconds), you could go for this example (from the React Docs):</p>
                <code>function tick() {
                          const element = (<br>
                            &lt;div><br>
                              &lt;h1>Hello, world!&lt;/h1><br>
                              &lt;h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2><br>
                            &lt;/div><br>
                          );<br>
                          ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));<br>
                        }<br>
                        
                        setInterval(tick, 1000);<br>
                </code>
                <p>Let me draw your attention to the last line. <code>setInterval()</code> is a method which continuously calls a function each <code>x</code> amount of time in miliseconds; in other words, each 1 second, <code>setInterval()</code> calls the function <code>tick()</code>, and it renders a new element showing the current time.</p>
                <p>This is also an example of what I said in the previous section: once <code>render()</code> is called, you don't stack up your DOM root node with a new element; it is actually re-rendered with only the elements you passed to the method the last time you called it.</p>
                <p>Also, here's a neat little thing about React: only the <code>div id="root"</code> is actually updated with the new clock element. The rest of the page remains as-is, which reduces a lot of page loading. Here is an interesting GIF <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html">from the React Docs</a>:</p>

                    <p>The greatest feature in React, in my opinion, is the hability to create Components. A React Component (abstract class <code>React.Component</code>) are the small pieces that compose the whole user interface.</p>

alt="comment_box_react">
                    <p><strong>The text at the top is a React Component. The textbox is a React Component. The button is a React component.</strong></p>
                    <p>Now you know what a Component looks like - but how does it work?</p>
                    <p>Enter <strong>Props</strong>. Props are shorthand for <em>Properties</em>, and they are a <em>read-only</em> argument you pass (by value) to every Component you create in react. You see that "Send" text inside that comment box's button? That could be a <code>props.text</code> (an item called "text" inside the Properties list) that was sent to, say, <code>CommentButton</code> and was displayed to the user. Being read-only means that the Component cannot assign another value to a certain props.</p>
                    <p>This button could be inside a certain file called <code>CommentButton.js</code> inside a <code>[project]/some/thing/components</code> folder, and we can create it by two forms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Function Component</strong>:<br>
                        <code>function CommentButton(props) {<br>
  return &lt;button>{props.value}&lt;/button><br>
  }</code>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Class Component (ES6)</strong>:<br>
                        <code>
                        import React, { Component } from 'react';<br>
                        class CommentButton extends React.Component {<br>
                          render() {<br>
                            return (<br>
                        		&lt;button>{this.props.textValue}&lt;/button><br>
                        	);<br>
                          }<br>
                        }<br>
                        export default CommentButton;<br>
                        </code></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>React sees those two Components as equivalents, but for us there are differences to be considered - they will be explained in the next section. For this specific example, I will be using CommentButton as a Class Component.</p>
                    <p>Now that I have this Component, I can use it on my front-end; I can place this component in <code>index.js</code> and it will be shown:</p>
                    <code>
                    import React from 'react';<br>
                    import CommentButton from '../../components/CommentButton';<br>
                        export default function ProductComment(){<br>
                        return(<br>
                    		&lt;div><br>
                    			&lt;CommentButton textValue="SEND"/><br>
                    		&lt;/div><br>
                        );<br>
                    }<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>This is really a very rough example of how you could instantiate the Component on a certain front-end Route - here called ProductComment(). Don't worry about that Route right now - <strong>I want you to focus on two lines here</strong>:</p>
                    <code>import CommentButton from '../../components/CommentButton';</code>
                    <p>To use the button component we created previously, we must <code>import</code> it. In this case I placed my CommentButton.js this two levels above my <code>index.js</code> file and inside a 'components' folder as denoted by "../../components" (aka "go two folders up"), but you could place it anywhere really - your project's file structure is really up to you.</p>
                    <p>Also notice how I imported "/CommentButton", not "/CommentButton.js". React knows you're importing a Component that was made using Javascript, so putting ".js" is pointless.</p>
                    <p>Now, the <em>second (but equally) important line</em> here is this one:</p>
                    <code>&lt;CommentButton textValue="SEND"/><br></code>
                    <p>This here is where <code>CommentButton</code> is actually instantiated. Notice how it is inside a certain <code>div</code>; React demands your elements to be well-organized inside divs, sections and any other type of container, it does not allow for you to "throw around" Components everywhere.<br> 
                    <p>Now, besides the div, there are two other things to be observed about this line: firstly, look at how we instantiated the Component. We used it kind of as we would use a regular HTML tag, even with a shorthand /&gt; closing for the tag - this is one of the great things in React, your Components are absurdly easy to use.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the <code>textValue</code> attribute is 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">written in camelCase</a>; this is the standard way to pass attributes and properties in React. There are some things that you should be aware about that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your Component should always pass properties as <code>camelCase</code>, as it is the good practice in React; their class/function will also access the property as <em>props.camelCaseProp</em>;</li>
                        <li><code>camelCase</code> also applies to regular HTML elements and its event handlers; a simple regular &lt;button&gt; would have its <code>onclick</code> styled as <code>onClick</code>; </li>
                        <li>Some attribute names are also changed in the context of an element or Component: know the &lt;button&gt; I just mentioned? If you were to style it, instead of having <code>class="button_class"</code>, you would have <code>className="button_class"</code>. This is because "class" is a reserved keyword in Javascript. Also you would have to <code>import</code> the CSS file in your libraries.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Lastly, if you wanted to instantiate this button several times with different text, the correct way to do so would be by saving the text values inside an array, and instantiate CommentButton using a <code>map()</code> function:</p>
                    <code>
                        {text_values_for_button.map(text_value_item => (
				&lt;CommentButton textValue={text_value_item}/>
			))}
                    </code>
                    <p>Simple and highly reusable, like everything in React. But there is more to it - Function and Class components are seen as equal by React, but for us, they have very crucial differences which will be explained in the next section.</p>

            </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                   <p>Instead of diving head-on on the difference between Function and Class Components, I'd like to talk a little more about State and Lifecycle.</p>
                   <ul>
                       
                       <li><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> Given the OOP context, the Lifecycle of an Object is the duration between when an Object is created until when it is destroyed. This is simple, and crucial for understanding what happens next;</li>
                       <li><strong>State:</strong> If you are somewhat experienced in programming, you might have seen before that <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/6536/definition-of-the-state-of-an-object-in-oop">"State" is a problematic definition</a>. In OOP, the State of an Object means the configuration it is at a certain point in its lifecycle: in other words, what values its properties contain at a given moment, starting from when it is instantiated until it is destroyed.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Why all the nerd-y talk? Because this is actually very relevant to us - when you create your React Component as a Function, you can't talk about "State" (i.e it is "Stateless"), as all it does is receive a certain input (props) and send back an output (your fully-built Component). This is not the case, however, when you have a Class Component; when you instantiate your Class Component, you're actually creating an instance of a class - the textbook definition of an Object. </p>
                   <p>Now that you have an Object, you have a lot more of flexibility on creating whatever it is that you are building; e.g. you can encapsulate and reuse a Component, and leverage <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html">composition</a>; the Docs advise against using inheritance, so be aware of that. For a practical example of encapsulation, <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">the React Docs have a very interesting example on a Clock component</a>.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>Towards the very end of the section called "JSX and Elements", I used the term "page load" between quotes. This is because a project that is fully built with React <em>doesn't change pages</em>, at least not in the way we are used to if you come from a raw HTML/JS context.</p>
                    <p>Through React, it is possible to build a whole application in one single page; this is known as a Single Page App (SPA). The advantages and disadvantages of this approach have been discussed exhaustively on the internet; I suggest you look it up.</p>
                    <p>Well - if there is no page reloading, then how does the page change? I mean, look at e.g. Instagram: there are many pages you can open up. You can see your friend's post, your feed, Stories and whatnot. How come the page never reloads even though you're accessing a lot of different screens?</p>
                    <p>Enter <strong>Routing</strong>. There is a library called <code>react-router</code>, developed by Michael Jackson (not the singer) and Ryan Florence, and which is vastly used by React apps to handle routing.</p>
                    <p>Why should you use routing? If you're coming from Laravel like I did, then routing is no great mystery to you; in fact, react-router can be quite arranged to work very similarly to how routing is done in Laravel, with of course some synthatic and semantical differences here and there.</p>
