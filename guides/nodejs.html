                <p>The web development industry has been undergoing some crazy times since the mid 2010s.</p>
                <p>If in 2009 you were to begin your career in web development, especially back-end, you would probably need to master either PHP or Perl. Some other languages too, maybe C. But nowadays most new projects are created using something that would seem crazy at that time - server-side Javascript, also known as NodeJS.</p>
                <p>My intention here is to discuss topics, from beginner to (hopefully) advanced contents, about this technology. This guide is brother to my ReactJS guide, whose link I shall update and post here soon.</p>
                <p>Hope this is useful somehow for you! Do not be afraid to get in touch through my Github.</p>

                <p>NodeJS is a server-side runtime that allows you to run asynchronous Javascript code. This definition is simple but has a lot of implications.</p>
                <p>First of all, NodeJS is server-side; it is a back-end technology. Along with it, you may use certain libraries like ReactJS or frameworks like Angular to build a whole application.</p>
                <p>Secondly, you can build both your back-end and your front-end using only one language (JS)! This one of the reasons that the job market for this stack (Node+Angular/React) has a very, very positive outlook (at least as of 2020)</p>
                <p>Last but not least, it is <em>async</em>. The further meaning of this will be explored soon, but for now, be aware of this: async means that unless you have some really heavy calculations going on in your process, NodeJS has tremendous escalability and is highly fast, especially comparing to older technologies like PHP (which is where I come from).</p>
                <p>So now you know *what* NodeJS is - but why should you care? Why should you bother to learn another stack? Keep reading.</p>

                <p>NodeJS has a lot of advantages over other other back-end techonologies such as an Apache server running PHP or Perl code, for example.</p>
                <p>Here's what you mostly need to know about and how NodeJS does its awesomeness:</p>
