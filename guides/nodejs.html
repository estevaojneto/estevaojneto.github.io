                <p>The web development industry has been undergoing some crazy times since the mid 2010s.</p>
                <p>If in 2009 you were to begin your career in web development, especially back-end, you would probably need to master either PHP or Perl. Some other languages too, maybe C. But nowadays most new projects are created using something that would seem crazy at that time - server-side Javascript, also known as NodeJS.</p>
                <p>My intention here is to discuss topics, from beginner to (hopefully) advanced contents, about this technology. This guide is brother to my ReactJS guide, whose link I shall update and post here soon.</p>
                <p>Hope this is useful somehow for you! Do not be afraid to get in touch through my Github.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>NodeJS is a server-side runtime that allows you to run asynchronous Javascript code. This definition is simple but has a lot of implications.</p>
                <p>First of all, NodeJS is server-side; it is a back-end technology. Along with it, you may use certain libraries like ReactJS or frameworks like Angular to build a whole application.</p>
                <p>Secondly, you can build both your back-end and your front-end using only one language (JS)! This one of the reasons that the job market for this stack (Node+Angular/React) has a very, very positive outlook (at least as of 2020)</p>
                <p>Last but not least, it is <em>async</em>. The further meaning of this will be explored soon, but for now, be aware of this: async means that unless you have some really heavy calculations going on in your process, NodeJS has tremendous escalability and is highly fast, especially comparing to older technologies like PHP (which is where I come from).</p>
                <p>So now you know *what* NodeJS is - but why should you care? Why should you bother to learn another stack? Keep reading.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h5>Why NodeJS?</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>NodeJS has a lot of advantages over other other back-end techonologies such as an Apache server running PHP or Perl code, for example.</p>
                <p>Here's why NodeJS is something you should look into if you're working in web development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NodeJS has an amazing escalability. Each request to Node is non-blocking, which means it is capable of handling an amazing amount of simultaneous requests without the hiccups we commonly see in overworked Apache servers, making it amazing for web development, distributed systems, microsservices and, well, anything that is not particularly heavy in complexity. This is made possible due to Node being an asynchronous process that runs its (famous) event loop on a single thread;</li>
                    <li>NodeJS is flexible. There are limitless possibilities to what you can build with it and its most famous libraries, frameworks and resources - you can use Angular, React, Express, Adonis and so much more to help you build your application or service. And all of that in just one very familiar language, which is Javascript;</li>
                    <li>NodeJS is easy. Most people who come from a front-end context will get Node very quickly because it uses Javascript, and most people who come from a back-end context will get Node very quickly because it does things in a much more simpler way than more traditional models;</li>
                    <li>NodeJS is profitable. I can't bring you any statistics because I am eager to get started on the more fun stuff of NodeJS, but it is very noticeable that the job opportunities for NodeJS are growing - fast. Although it is everywhere, Node is especially useful in startups, where development must happen fast, managers must reduce overhead and VC cannot be wasted.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Now that we have gotten that out of the way, I can start explaning you things in more detail!</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h5>Event loop: Nodes' secret spice</h5></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>In Node literature, a term that commonly pops up is "Event Loop". Explanantions for what it is range from completely simple and short to long and complex; I'll have my hand at explaning it, I hope you find it satisfactory. If not, I recommend looking other sources because understanding why Node is different from traditional server languages/libraries/frameworks is key to understanding and writing great code.</p>
                <p>You see, when we say that NodeJS is single-threaded, that's actually a facade (*wink* for my fellow Laravel devs) for saying that "the V8 Javascript engine running Node is single-threaded" - Node would not be able to do everything async if its <strong>libuv</strong> wasn't multi-threaded.</p>
                <p>So we now have new terminology here: libuv. libuv is a crucial part of NodeJS: it is an open-source library written especifically with NodeJS in mind, but now also used by other projects. What it does is it handles background threads received from the function call stack, and also handles their callback.</p>
                <p>Let's try to be a little more practical here. Picture the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You write a call to a certain function <code>fetchDataFromServer()</code>, whose purpose is to fetch data from a server (well); this function also has a <code>callback</code>, which is another function which tells the program what to do when data is finally here.</li>
                    <li>Once this instruction is read, the call is moved to the <strong>Call Stack</strong>. </li>
                    <li>The call stack won't stay put waiting for an answer from the server; it will move keep stacking any other instructions, functions and whatever your code is doing.
                    <li>So in comes libuv; it will be responsible for making sure your <code>fetch</code> is executed, by allocating a certain thread to attend to this request in background.</li>
                    <li>Once a response or an error (typically called <code>res</code> or <code>err</code>) is received, then libuv moves the callback function into a certain queue called the <strong>Task Queue</strong>. It essentially queues callbacks for completed function calls - in this case, fetchin data.</li>
                    <li>Because V8 (Node's JS engine inherited from Chrome) is single-threaded, the Call Stack must be free before we can move our callback into it and be executed. Upon being executed, we're back into the beginning of the cycle again. This is why it is called an Event Loop.</li>
                </ul>
